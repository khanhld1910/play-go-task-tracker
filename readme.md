# Play Go - Task Tracker

This is my first project to practice what I've learned in Go following this [back-end roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend) and [Golang roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/golang).
The requirements for this project can be found at roadmap.sh's [Task Tracker](https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker) project
